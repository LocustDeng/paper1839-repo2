# paper1839-repo2
Codes for paper 1839.<br>In response to **R5**, we provide the project code here to verify the **authenticity** of the study. However, in order to protect the intellectual property of the current research stage, we have **obfuscated** some necessary core modules in the code, but this does not affect the understanding of the core logic. We will publish the full code after the paper is accepted.

In addition, any content in the code that might reveal the author information has also been **eliminated**.

The **"train_mine.sh"** and **"eval_mine.sh"** files in the project are the scripts we used for training and testing, and the **"eval_log_n"** file is the log file that we output when we perform the dataset evaluation, which contains our evaluation results.
